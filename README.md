## Hi there üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
My name is Jesper. I'm a 20-something (getting close to 30-something though üò≠) guy from Norway. Currently based in Oslo. Working as a developer at Oslo Digital. At Oslo Digital we focus on the customers digital transformation, mainly in the way of e-commerce. So my job is to deliver e-commerce systems that integrates with the customers existing systems or help them in selecting new systems. When I am not working I like long walks on de_dust2, supporting my dota2 carries (that means gaming), photography and streaming. What I stream can vary from building a flappy bird clone in HTML to playing The Elder Scrolls: Oblivion.

## What I work with
Unhappily working on a Windows installation on my macbook when working with one of the e-commerce frameworks that we have partnered up with. They are working on a .NET Core release that should be out by now, we just havn't gotten to use it in a project yet.
Codeeditors are Visual Studio and Visual Studio code. Both on Windows and only VS Code on OSX.

## What I wanna work with
In an ideal world I would have enough time to finish some of my many side-projects that I start on through streaming or just by being keen on learning. I have some personal opinions on tech-stacks but I am more focused on creating something awesome for the people who will be using the software. But I have been teaching myself some golang and svelte-kit recently.
