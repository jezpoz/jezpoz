## Hi there üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
My name is Jesper. I'm a 20-something guy from Norway. Currently based in Oslo. Working as a frontend developer at Crystallize. When I am not working I like long walks on de_dust2, supporting my dota2 carries (that means gaming), photography and streaming. What I stream can vary from building a flappy bird clone in HTML to playing The Elder Scrolls: Oblivion.

## What I wanna work with
In an ideal world I would have enough time to finish some of my many side-projects that I start on through streaming or just by being keen on learning. I have some personal opinions on tech-stacks but I am more focused on creating something awesome for the people who will be using the software. But I have been teaching myself some golang and svelte-kit recently.
